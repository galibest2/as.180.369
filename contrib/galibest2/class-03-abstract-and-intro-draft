As immigration policies grow and change with the nation and its political landscape, many narratives are presented to the media regarding the impact immigrants have on native-born workers. Through this paper, I hope to focus on the impact of immigration on labor force participation. I aim to track media coverage regarding immigration policy and note if any changes in labor participation can be more closely correlated to media coverage rather than economic impacts. 

Within the paper I hope to highlight the following cases of immigration: immigrants are high-skilled complements, immigrants are low-skilled complements, immigrants are high-skilled substitutes, and immigrants are low-skilled substitutes. Most media coverage tends to highlight cases where immigrants are viewed as perfect substitutes, but I hope to shed some light on how often that is the case and how variety among immigrant types will yield different economic outcomes. I believe that a negative media perception may yield outcomes that are less in line with economic theory. I hope that with these findings we can understand how to structure more productive conversations surrounding immigration.

As my paper progresses, I hope to establish immigration’s impact on native-born workers ranging from unemployment to discouragement based on the works of Ríos‐Avila (Ríos‐Avila, 2016). I then aim to recognize and highlight some trends surrounding native internal migration as highlighted in the works of Borjas and Card (Borjas, 2021) (Card, 2001). Following this, I hope to establish core differences between theory and literature regarding labor-market competition and immigration policy taking inspiration from Scheve's research (Scheve, 2001). Eventually, I will establish a model to display the labor market impact of immigration similar to the model created by Dustmann (Dustmann, 2008). Finally, I hope to look at the case study surrounding the effect of the Mariel Boatlift as researched by Card in addition to tracking the media reaction during the study (Card, 1990).
