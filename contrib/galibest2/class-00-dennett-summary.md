#Summary Draft

Daniel Dennett's article, "The Problem with Counterfeit People" was written to inform the reader of potential harms from a lack of AI regulation while highlighting ways to mitigate these harms. 

Dennett starts his article by asserting that AI-generated counterfeit personas erode trust between online consumers and producers. To help the readers understand the impact of counterfeit personas, Dennett establishes a comparison between counterfeit personas and counterfeit money. The main commonality between both counterfeits is the false sense of security that surrounds them. I would go as far as to assert that the most impactful role of this comparison was its ability to help establish the scope of fraud in both instances.

While it is harmful to have fraudulent money within the market, there are measures and regulations at play to make checking for a fraudulent bill merely a formality. In contrast, Dennett asserts that counterfeit AI persons will encourage individuals to constantly be guarded during online reactions in fear of being a victim of engaging with fraud. 

Over the years, AI has evolved past simple applications like text-to-speech or an automated assistant. These models have been trained from large language models (LLMs) to create realistic responses and mimic human interactions. Due to how realistic these counterfeit people can be, online consumers may fall into the trap of believing that an AI persona is a real person. Examples of this could include a chatbot's response using parsed information from various sources. These sources have varying levels of credibility which can actively spread misinformation to their trusting audience. This could lead to a collapse of democracy itself as Dennett emphasizes that "...[democracy] depends on the informed (not misinformed) consent of the governed." Thus if the governed become distracted and confused Dennett believes that more people will be coerced into "...adopting policies and convictions that will make [them] vulnerable to still more manipulation." 

Outside of these ethical concerns, an interesting point that Dennett later highlights is that AI models learn and grow.  To simplify this concept, Dennett describes the innovation of AI as something similar to natural selection. 

Through evolution, animals that have superior genetics will survive while unfit animals will eventually die off. Similar to a genetic pool, the AI model is exposed to various source materials through the LLM. Algorithm designers will continue to develop smarter algorithms and LLMs will grow to include information that can help form more efficient and accurate models. 

An interesting way to visualize this would be to consider an LLM as a library. If a library only has one book, the AI will have a narrow scope. If more books are added the AI can refer to more rules and find more patterns. The most impactful part of AI training takes place when more niche items are added to this library. Once this happens, the model can correctly answer more convoluted questions. Consequently, AI models will grow as the landscape continues to evolve so that only the smartest and fittest models will survive.

A direct result of more efficient AI models is more explosive adoption due to economic benefits. 

With the help of AI, many menial tasks can be automized. In theory, this should result in a positive impact for there will be more productivity as technology increases. Yet, the one variable that is not held constant in this scenario is the security of sensitive information. 

Many information-sensitive industries recognize the same concerns that Dennett has surrounding the impact of claims from a fraudulent persona: misinformation can spread like wildfire if it comes from a "trusted" source. The likelihood of this happening increases with AI adoption since every time an AI is utilized the data bank will grow with its newly attained information. This in turn releases sensitive information to the public. To mitigate the odds of mass misinformation, Dennett offers potential regulatory solutions. Some examples Dennett suggests are holding large AI companies liable for misuse and mandating enforcement of disclosure when an AI is operating an account.

While Dennett provides novel suggestions to help regulate AI, many of his ideas depend on legislators aligning with his agenda. I believe that private action will help limit the spread of sensitive data sooner than public action. 

Private actors have already started to take steps in the right direction by considering the creation of private AI LLMs. Since LLMs play a key role in AI, a private LLM would help keep sensitive data siloed. Thus, we could still see the economic benefits of AI, such as increased labor productivity, with a decreased risk of spreading misinformation. 

Even though I feel that Dennett overlooks the importance of private sector innovation, I feel that many of his regulation suggestions could only make the online world safer by reinvolving morals into the AI conversation. 

It should be our main priority to preserve the integrity of online spheres. Furthermore, I commend Dennett for recentering a conversation commonly focused on economic benefits back to the impact it has on everyday consumers.
