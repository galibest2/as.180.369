One of the core takeaways of Dennett's article is that AI-generated counterfeit personas erode trust between online consumers and producers. Furthermore, Dennett argues that these advancements erode human freedom through misinformation. Due to how realistic these counterfeit people can be, online consumers may fall into the trap of believing that this AI advancement is a real person with their interests in mind. An interesting point that Dennet highlights is that AI models continue to learn from one another which encourages a "natural selection" like process to take place. Through evolution, animals that have superior genetics will survive while unfit animals will eventually die off. Through AI models learning from the mistakes and data of others, only the smartest and fittest models will survive.  

In my personal opinion, I feel that this core fact should offer reassurance since LLMs are only as intelligent as the information that is given to them. Throughout this AI boom, multiple information-sensitive industries such as the financial industry have been looking into ways in which they could reap the economic reward of AI while not putting their information at risk. While some firms have decided to make their own LLMs that do not share data with public offerings we see that these AIs will be siloed. 

Thus, a core way to limit the negative implications of AI usage is by limiting the data that it is exposed to and by implementing regulation measures to increase transparency within its application. Dennet notes that a great step in reinforcing security against counterfeit people is for AI to disclose when they are AI models alongside further regulations. Dennett ends by emphasizing that AI has a myriad of economic benefits but it is time to reinstate the moral obligations of AI promoters and users.
