Summary Draft

After reading Daniel Dennett's article, I feel that this was an article written to inform the reader of potential harms from a lack of AI regulation while highlighting ways to mitigate these harms. 

Dennett starts his article by asserting that AI-generated counterfeit personas erode trust between online consumers and producers. To help the readers understand the impact of counterfeit personas, Dennett establishes a comparison between counterfeit personas and counterfeit money. The main commonality between both counterfeits is the false sense of security that surrounds them. While readers may not grasp the false sense of security obtained through fake personas, they can easily relate to the frustration of finding a fraudulent bill in their wallet. I would go as far as to assert that the most impactful role of this comparison is to help establish the scope of fraud in both instances.

While it is harmful to have fraudulent money within the market, there are measures and regulations at play to make checking for a fraudulent bill nearly a formality. In contrast, Deent asserts that counterfeit AI persons will encourage individuals to constantly be guarded during online reactions in fear of being a victim of engaging with fraud. 

Over the years, AI has evolved past simple applications like text-to-speech or an automated assistant. These models have been trained from large language models (LLMs) to create realistic responses to mimic human interactions. Due to how realistic these counterfeit people can be, online consumers may fall into the trap of believing that an AI persona is a real person. Examples of this could include a chatbot's response using parsed information from various online sources. These sources have varying levels of credibility which can actively spread misinformation to their trusting audience. This could lead to a collapse of democracy itself for Dennett emphasizes that "...[democracy] depends on the informed (not misinformed) consent of the governed." Thus if the governed become distracted and confused Dennett believes that more people will be coerced into "...adopting policies and convictions that will make [them] vulnerable to still more manipulation." 

Outside of these ethical concerns, an interesting point that Dennet later highlights is that AI models learn and grow. 

In another attempt to simplify this concept, Dennet describes the innovation of AI as something similar to natural selection. 

Through evolution, animals that have superior genetics will survive while unfit animals will eventually die off. Similar to a genetic pool, the AI model is exposed to various source materials through the LLM. Algorithm designers will continue to develop smarter algorithms and LLMs will grow to include information that can help form more efficient and accurate models. 

An interesting way to visualize this would be to consider an LLM as a library. If a library only has one book, the AI will have a narrow scope. If more books are added the AI can refer to more rules and find more patterns. The most impactful part of AI training takes place when more niche items are added to this library so they can correctly answer more convoluted questions. Consequently, AI models will grow as the landscape continues to evolve so that only the smartest and fittest models will survive.

A direct result of more efficient AI models is more explosive adoption due to economic benefits. 

With the help of AI, many menial tasks can be automized instead of having to utilize human labor. For example, in the financial industry, some economic benefits that can be seen through the utilization of AI are more efficient analysts due to a decrease in the time needed to find materials within financial files or outlining templates for commonly used documents. In theory, this should result in a positive impact for there will be more productivity as technology increases. Yet, the one variable that is not held constant in this scenario is the security of sensitive information. 

The financial industry and many other information-sensitive industries recognize the same concerns that Dennett has surrounding the impact of claims from a fraudulent persona. The likelihood of this happening increases with AI adoption since every time an AI is utilized the data bank will grow with its newly attained information. This in turn releases sensitive information to the public and can increase misinformation. Based on this training process, I believe that regulation on a public scale may not be necessary in order to protect the broader public.

While Dennett provides novel suggestions to help regulate AI, many of his ideas depend on legislators aligning with his agenda or on the widespread adoption of AI scanners. One example that Dennett highlights is the enforcement of disclosure when an AI is operating an account or within an online space. This would help ensure that transparency is upheld in the digital world. Dennett paints a dire picture in terms of public adoption, but I believe that private action will help limit the spread of sensitive data. 

For example, information-sensitive industries have recognized the role of LLMs in training AI and are actively considering creating their own private AI servers so that the data can remain siloed. Thus, we could still see the economic benefits of AI with a decreased risk of spreading misinformation. 

Even though I feel that Dennett overlooks the importance of private sector innovation, I feel that many of his regulation suggestions could only make the online world safer by reinvolving morals into the AI conversation.
