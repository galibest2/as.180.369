Summary Draft

One of the core takeaways of Dennett's article is that AI-generated counterfeit personas erode trust between online consumers and producers. To help the readers understand the impact of counterfeit personas, Dennett establishes a comparison between counterfeit personas and counterfeit money. Both counterfeits offer individuals who interact with them a false sense of security and while readers may not grasp the false sense of security that is obtained through fake personas, they can easily relate to the frustration of finding a fraudulent bill within their wallet.

Furthermore, Dennett argues that these advancements erode human freedom through misinformation. Over the years, AI has evolved past simple applications like text-to-speech or an automated assistant. These models have been developed to be trained from large language models (LLMs) to create realistic responses to human engagement. Due to how realistic these counterfeit people can be, online consumers may fall into the trap of believing that this AI advancement is a real person with their interests in mind. Examples of this can be a chatbot's response using parsed information from various online sources with varying credibility or a chatbot actively spreading misinformation while posing as a well-known news anchor. Dennett further asserts that "...[democracy] depends on the informed (not misinformed) consent of the governed." Thus if the governed become distracted and confused Dennett believes that more people will be coerced into "...adopting policies and convictions that will make [them] vulnerable to still more manipulation." 

Outside of these ethical concerns, an interesting point that Dennet highlights is that AI models continue to learn from one another which encourages a "natural selection" like process to take place. Through evolution, animals that have superior genetics will survive while unfit animals will eventually die off. Similar to a genetic pool, the AI is exposed to various source materials through the LLM. Algorithm designers will continue to develop smarter algorithms and LLMs will grow to include information that can help form more efficient and accurate models. An interesting way to visualize this would be to consider an LLM as a library. If a library only has one book, the AI will have a narrow scope. If more books are added the AI can refer to more rules and find more patterns. The most impactful part of AI training takes place when more niche items are added to this library so they can correctly answer more convoluted questions. Consequently, AI models will grow as the landscape continues to evolve so that only the smartest and fittest models will survive. 

In my personal opinion, I feel that this core fact should offer reassurance since LLMs are only as intelligent as the information that is given to them. Throughout this AI boom, multiple information-sensitive industries such as the financial industry have been looking into ways in which they could reap the economic reward of AI while not putting their information at risk. While some firms have decided to make their own LLMs that do not share data with public offerings we see that these AIs will be siloed. 

In response to Dennet's assertion of increasing regulation to preserve the integrity of online interactions, I feel that a core way to limit the negative implications of AI usage is by limiting the data the model is exposed to. Furthermore, we can implement regulation measures to increase transparency within the application of AI. An example that Dennett highlights is the enforcement of disclosure when an AI is operating an account or within an online space. Dennett ends by emphasizing that AI has a myriad of economic benefits but it is time to reinstate the moral obligations of AI promoters and users.
