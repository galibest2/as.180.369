Summary Draft

One of the core takeaways of Dennett's article is that AI-generated counterfeit personas erode trust between online consumers and producers. To help the readers understand the impact of counterfeit personas, Dennett establishes a comparison between counterfeit personas and counterfeit money. Both counterfeits offer individuals who interact with them a false sense of security and while readers may not grasp the false sense of security that is obtained through fake personas, they can easily relate to the frustration of finding a fraudulent bill within their wallet.

Furthermore, Dennett argues that these advancements erode human freedom through misinformation. Over the years, AI has evolved past simple applications like text-to-speech or an automated assistant. These models have been developed to be trained from large language models (LLMs) to create realistic responses to human engagement. Due to how realistic these counterfeit people can be, online consumers may fall into the trap of believing that this AI advancement is a real person with their interests in mind. Examples of this can be a chatbot's response using parsed information from various online sources with varying credibility or a chatbot actively spreading misinformation while posing as a well-known news anchor. Dennett further asserts that "...[democracy] depends on the informed (not misinformed) consent of the governed." Thus if the governed become distracted and confused Dennett believes that more people will be coerced into "...adopting policies and convictions that will make [them] vulnerable to still more manipulation." 

Outside of these ethical concerns, an interesting point that Dennet highlights is that AI models continue to learn from one another which encourages a "natural selection" like process to take place. Through evolution, animals that have superior genetics will survive while unfit animals will eventually die off. Similar to a genetic pool, the AI is exposed to various source materials through the LLM. Algorithm designers will continue to develop smarter algorithms and LLMs will grow to include information that can help form more efficient and accurate models. An interesting way to visualize this would be to consider an LLM as a library. If a library only has one book, the AI will have a narrow scope. If more books are added the AI can refer to more rules and find more patterns. The most impactful part of AI training takes place when more niche items are added to this library so they can correctly answer more convoluted questions. Consequently, AI models will grow as the landscape continues to evolve so that only the smartest and fittest models will survive. 

In my personal opinion, I feel that this core fact should offer reassurance since LLMs are only as intelligent as the information that is given to them. 

Throughout this AI boom, multiple information-sensitive industries such as the financial industry have been looking into ways in which they could reap the economic reward of AI while not putting their information at risk. 

Dennett emphasizes in his article how explosive adoption has been due to these economic benefits. With the help of AI, many menial tasks can be automized instead of having to utilize human labor. For example, in the financial industry, some economic benefits that can be seen through the utilization of AI are more efficient analysts due to a decrease in the time needed to find materials within financial files or outlining templates for commonly used documents. In theory, this should result in a positive impact for there will be more productivity as technology increases. Yet, the one variable that is not held constant in this scenario is the security of sensitive information. The financial industry, and many other information-sensitive industries, recognizes the same concerns that Dennett has surrounding the impact of a fraudulent persona making a false claim. The likelihood of this happening increases with AI adoption for each utilization of the tool helps strengthen the algorithm and build its data bank which can in turn release sensitive information to the public. Based on this training process, I believe that regulation on a public scale may not be needed in order to protect the broader public.

While Dennett provides novel suggestions to help regulate AI, a lot of his ideas hinge on legislators aligning with his agenda or for the widespread adoption of AI scanners. Dennett continues to paint a dire picture but while public action may be slow, private action will help limit the spread of sensitive data. For example, information-sensitive industries have recognized the role of LLMs in training AI and are actively considering creating their own private AI servers so that the data can remain siloed. Thus, we could still see the economic benefits of AI with a decreased risk of spreading misinformation. 

Although I feel that Dennett does not consider how impactful this private AI server implementation would be, I feel that many of his regulation suggestions could only make the online world safer. An example that Dennett highlights is the enforcement of disclosure when an AI is operating an account or within an online space. Thus ensuring that transparency is restored in the digital world.
