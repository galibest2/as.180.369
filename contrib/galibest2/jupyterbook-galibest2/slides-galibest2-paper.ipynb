    "This paper showcases how reality deviates from economic theory and whether media coverage drives these deviations when analyzing immigration's impact on labor force participation. Understanding the relationship between immigration, media coverage, and fluctuations in native-born labor force participation is key to decreasing negative implications. These findings grow more important as rhetoric becomes more polarized and changes in labor force participation grow more alarming."

With this data collection strategy, misinformation and core publications will be represented but through an additional variable, core publications will have a heavier weight.

This paper also highlighted that Miami was better acclimated to support an influx of immigrants ––especially Hispanic immigrants{cite:p}`Card1990-au`. This is due to their economy having a large number of complementary jobs to low-skill labor which aided in job mobility of native-born workers instead of unemployment. Furthermore due to core factors, like a lower language barrier, the assimilation of immigrants was high which led to a more productive market that increased the labor demand potentially offsetting any wage decreases in many jobs.

    "As highlighted by {cite:t}`Card1990-au`, the influx of immigrants from the boatlift led to some internal emigration of native-born Americans and potentially discouraged immigration of some other immigrants. This migration aids in explaining why on a national level substantial wage effects are seen yet on a state level there are negligible impacts {cite:p}`Borjas2021-xq`. The logic highlighted in this piece of literature is that the scope of the labor market is a core determinant of the impact. Seeing that the labor market is dynamic and –– when all other variables  are held equal –– individuals can  move between markets, the state-level analysis may see no net effect due to emigration and immigration canceling each other. On a national level, the main effect witnessed is due to immigration since emigration from the nation is usually lower. "

    "The core hypothesis of this paper is that deviations from economic theory will align with moments where media coverage surrounding immigration was predominantly negative. These deviations will nearly equivocally be present within the calculated labor force participation rate due to the discouraged worker effect {cite:p}`RiosAvila2016-ja`. This prediction was made under the current notion that media narratives can heavily influence public sentiment {cite:p}`Djourelova2023-dx`. This hypothesis extends this notion to highlight that media can transitively also influence labor market dynamics."

Drawing from immigration data, the number and skill set of immigrants will be logged. Based on this dataset, predictions will be made based on economic theory. For example, if there is a majority of complementary low-skill workers theory predicts more labor participation in high-skill work."

    "The econometric model used was an OLS model with change in the labor force participation rate being the dependent variable, and  the overall sentiment surrounding immigration and interest in immigration policy being the independent variables. The form of the model is linear with a log-likelihood of -95.362. The coefficient estimates of the overall sentiment are 0.0016 and -0.0005 for policy interest with a standard error of 0.003 and 0.002 respectively. The model notes that the standard errors are heteroscedasticity robust. The coefficient of the overall sentiment represents the causal effect that overall sentiment has on changing the labor force participation rate. It should be noted that the coefficient of the policy represents a partial effect on the changes in the labor force participation rate.  Based on these coefficients, the overall sentiment that is encouraged by the media has a positive relationship with changes in labor force participation. It is noted also that the partial effect of policy interest is inverse to that of the causal effect but at a smaller magnitude. The t-statistics for overall sentiment and policy interest were 0.555 and -0.253 respectively. Additionally, the p-values for overall sentiment and policy interest were 0.579 and .800 respectively."
