## Immigration and Unemployment

### Ríos-Avila (2016) *Unemployed, Now What? The Effect of Immigration on Unemployment Transitions of Native-born Workers in the United States*

**Main Take-Away:**

Using the basic monthly Current Population Survey from 2001–13 the authors matched data for individuals who were interviewed in two consecutive months and identified workers who transition out of unemployment. The authors employed a multinomial model to examine the effects of immigration on the transition out of unemployment, using state-level immigration statistics. The results suggest that immigration does not affect the probabilities of native-born workers finding a job. Instead, the authors found that immigration is associated with smaller probabilities of remaining unemployed, but it is also associated with higher probabilities of workers leaving the labor force. This effect impacts mostly young and less educated people.

**Paper Connection:**

Looking into how the media impacts the probability of workers leaving the labor force. The following findings are highlighted in the paper:

*"...the main driving force of this effect is the expectation that immigration lowers wages and reduces the number of jobs available in the job market. This creates a discouraged worker effect, pushing people who would otherwise have remained unemployed out of the labor force."*

It was also noted that "...only illegal immigration is found to be related to the observed differences in the transition rates out of unemployment and out of the labor force."

While recognizing rhetoric surrounding illegal immigration is a core focus of the media, I would like to see how much of the discouraged worker effect is also influenced by the media's coverage. Especially since the highlighted effect is mainly witnessed in the short run within economic theory.

### Ríos-Avila (2020) *The Effect of Immigration on Labor Market Transitions of Native-Born Unemployed in the United States*

**Main Takeaways:**

Concentrated their interest in unemployed individuals, as they are
the most likely to be affected by the presence of immigrants when searching for jobs in the labor market

The results suggest that immigration does not affect attrition, nor the probabilities of native-born workers finding a job. Instead, we find that immigration is associated with smaller probabilities of remaining unemployed. The authors also found some weak evidence that unauthorized immigration may increase the risk of attrition.

**Paper Connection:**

The following findings were highlighted in the paper: 

*"Also, we find a marginally significant and small risk of unemployed native-born citizens’ leaving the labor force if they live in a state that experiences a significantly significant and positive net flow of immigrants. While the estimated effects are small across all groups, they suggest the effect may be more prevalent among relatively young unemployed women with a high school degree"*

Noting this, I believe that these states with higher immigration levels would have more coverage and thus the media narrative may have a heavier importance.
