## Immigration and Unemployment

### Ríos-Avila (2016) *Unemployed, Now What? The Effect of Immigration on Unemployment Transitions of Native-born Workers in the United States*

**Main Take-Away:**

Using the basic monthly Current Population Survey from 2001–13 the authors matched data for individuals who were interviewed in two consecutive months and identified workers who transition out of unemployment. The authors employed a multinomial model to examine the effects of immigration on the transition out of unemployment, using state-level immigration statistics. The results suggest that immigration does not affect the probabilities of native-born workers finding a job. Instead, the authors found that immigration is associated with smaller probabilities of remaining unemployed, but it is also associated with higher probabilities of workers leaving the labor force. This effect impacts mostly young and less educated people.

**Paper Connection:**

Looking into how the media impacts the probability of workers leaving the labor force. The following findings are highlighted in the paper:

*"...the main driving force of this effect is the expectation that immigration lowers wages and reduces the number of jobs available in the job market. This creates a discouraged worker effect, pushing people who would otherwise have remained unemployed out of the labor force."*

It was also noted that "...only illegal immigration is found to be related to the observed differences in the transition rates out of unemployment and out of the labor force."

While recognizing rhetoric surrounding illegal immigration is a core focus of the media, I would like to see how much of the discouraged worker effect is also influenced by the media's coverage. Especially since the highlighted effect is mainly witnessed in the short run within economic theory.

### Ríos-Avila (2020) *The Effect of Immigration on Labor Market Transitions of Native-Born Unemployed in the United States*

**Main Takeaways:**

Concentrated their interest in unemployed individuals, as they are
the most likely to be affected by the presence of immigrants when searching for jobs in the labor market

The results suggest that immigration does not affect attrition, nor the probabilities of native-born workers finding a job. Instead, we find that immigration is associated with smaller probabilities of remaining unemployed. The authors also found some weak evidence that unauthorized immigration may increase the risk of attrition.

**Paper Connection:**

The following findings were highlighted in the paper: 

*"Also, we find a marginally significant and small risk of unemployed native-born citizens’ leaving the labor force if they live in a state that experiences a significantly significant and positive net flow of immigrants. While the estimated effects are small across all groups, they suggest the effect may be more prevalent among relatively young unemployed women with a high school degree"*

Noting this, I believe that these states with higher immigration levels would have more coverage and thus the media narrative may have a heavier importance.

### Borjas (2006) *Native Internal Migration and the Labor Market Impact of Immigration*

**Main Takeaways:**

Immigration is associated with lower in-migration rates, higher out-migration rates, and a decline in the growth rate of the native workforce. The response attenuates the measured impact of immigration on the labor market by 40 to 60 percent, depending on whether the labor market is defined at the state or metropolitan area level.


**Paper Connection:**

This paper analyzes how internal migration decisions made by native workers may explain why on a national level substantial wage effects are seen yet on a state level there are negligable impacts. I hope to see how media coverage especially taking into account the states that have the most biased narratives may correlate with this migration.  


### Card (2001) *Immigrant Inflows, Native Outflows, and the Local Labor Market Impacts of Higher Immigration*

**Main Takeaways:**

Found  that intercity mobility rates of natives and earlier immigrants are insensitive to immigrant inflows. However, occupation-specific wages and employment  rates  are  systematically  lower  in  cities  with  higher relative supplies of workers in a given occupation. The results imply that immigrant inflows over the 1980s reduced wages and employment  rates  of  low-skilled  natives  in  traditional  gateway  cities  like Miami and Los Angeles by 1–3 percentage points.


**Paper Connection:**

The paper notes that the notion of "immigrant inflows affect[ing] native employment rates [being a] new" conclusion but the results of the article suggest that "these massive expansions may have significantly reduced employment rates for younger and less-educated natives in these cities". Noting that the change should be limited, I want to see how labor force participation changed and if this change can be more attributed to discouraged workers instead of an inability to get employed.

### Card (1990) *THE IMPACT OF THE MARIEL BOATLIFT ON THE MIAMI LABOR MARKET*

**Main Takeaways:**

An analysis of wages of non-Cuban workers
over the 1979-85 period reveals virtually no effect of the Mariel influx. Likewise, there is no indication that the Boatlift led to an increase in the unemployment rates of less-skilled blacks or other non-Cuban workers. Even among the Cuban population wages and unemployment rates of earlier immigrants were not substantially affected by the arrival of the Mariels.

**Paper Connection:**

While other papers stress how internal migration decisions made by native workers may explain why on a national level substantial wage effects are seen yet on a state level, I hope to show how public perception of the Mariels led to better assimilation and decreased discouragement that could have been witnessed.

### Hainmuller (2014) *Public Attitudes toward Immigration*

**Main Takeaways:**

Consistently, immigration attitudes show little evidence of being strongly correlated with personal economic circumstances. Instead, research finds that immigration attitudes are shaped by sociotropic concerns about its cultural impacts—and to a lesser extent its economic impacts—on the nation as a whole. Still, more work is needed to strengthen the causal identification
of sociotropic concerns and to isolate precisely how, when, and why they
matter for attitude formation.

**Paper Connection:**

The following quote from the paper roots my hypothesis within current literature for I not only hope to prove that media coverage regarding immigration attitudes while potentially shedding light on potential cultural influences:

*"On the economic side, existing research has connected immigration attitudes with general
economic conditions, a finding that is consistent with claims that immigration attitudes are sociotropic and economic in orientation. Indeed, attitudes toward immigration correlate closely
with respondents’ perceptions about immigration’s economic impacts on the nation or other social aggregates. Relatedly, high-skilled immigrants are consistently preferred for admission. All
of this is evidence that people assess immigration based on perceptions of its national economic
impact.

Perceptions about immigrants’ impact on aspects of national identity and culture—especially
those related to language—have also proven influential. Still, relatively few studies have considered
the impact of sociotropic economic considerations alongside sociotropic cultural considerations
(but see Sniderman et al. 2004), making it unclear how much weight to accord each explanation. "*


I feel that my methodology also allows for both impacts to be weighed to the same degree that they influence the population.

### Scheve (2001) *Labor-Market Competition and Individual Preferences Over Immigration Policy*

**Main Takeaways:**

This paper uses three years of individual-level data to analyze the determinants of individual preferences over immigration policy in the United States. The authors  have two main empirical results: 

1. Less-skilled workers are significantly more likely to prefer limiting immigrant inflows into the United States. Our finding suggests that, over the time horizons that are relevant to individuals when evaluating immigration policy, individuals think that the U.S. economy absorbs immigrant inflows at least partly by changing wages.
2. No evidence was found that the relationship between skills and immigration opinions is stronger in high-immigration communities


**Paper Connection:**

I think it would be impactful to look at what narrative less-skilled workers tend to consume and as a consequence how the media may create an echo chamber of negative immigration sentiment.

### Berg (2010) *Attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policy*

**Main Takeaways:**

Specifically, the author examines the power of a core network approach, which suggests that individuals’ personal contacts influence immigration attitudes, and a symbolic racism framework, which argues that whites develop relatively stable values and beliefs during
childhood and adulthood about the personal limitations and costs of immigrants. Multilevel models and logistic regression models indicate that core networks consisting of higher levels of education and non-white contacts influence native-born whites to hold a pro-immigrant attitude, while older and tighter networks have the opposite effect. At the same time, core networks also condition the impact of group threat and intergroup contact on immigration attitudes, suggesting that the interpersonal environment and broader social environment interact during opinion formation. Furthermore, symbolically racist native-born whites are more likely to hold antiimmigrant opinions, independent of their feelings of labor market competition.

**Paper Connection:**

I would love to analyze how the diversity of news reporting has changed over the years and how polarization may have impacted attitudes toward immigration and immigration policy. As a consequence of this I would like to see how this relates to individuals growing more discouraged and the labor force participation rates of states with similar demographic views.


## Media and Immigration Perception

### Sadler (2021) *A qualitative contextual analysis of U.S. immigration coverage by media during the Obama and Trump presidencies*

**Main Takeaways:**

This qualitative analysis examines the frequency and sentiment of immigration-related posts by media organizations and audience reactions on Facebook from the last term of Barack Obama’s presidency and the first term of Donald Trump’s presidency, January 2013–December 2020, under the lens of critical race and agenda-building theories. Results indicate that news media have increased posting about this topic since 2013, the sentiment is statistically negative and audiences have elevated their participation over time.

Participatory agenda-building is an extension of Berkowitz’s (1987) example of public relations-driven news content to include audience interaction. As mentioned previously, Pérez-Díaz et al. (2020) and Abdenour’s (2016) research indicated that viewers’ social engagement with content not only kept topics prominent longer but the organic interpersonal interactions sometimes prompted future coverage. Data here may indicate shifts in coverage and social promotion decisions that rely not only on relationships with political figures but also on audiences and their digital interaction behaviors.

**Paper Connection:**

I hope to reference the engagement breakdown and use this time period as a case study.

I also aim to use this as a way to gauge how long-lasting the effects of media may be in forming an echo chamber. For example, if more polarized and baiting articles are created for engagement, the social divide that is shown in other articles will be witnessed for longer thus also extending the impacts on the labor market.

### Mohamed (2020) *‘Bad hombres’? An examination of identities in U.S. media coverage of immigration*

**Main Takeaways:**

In comparison to the true demographics of
immigrants in the U.S., press portrayals significantly over-represent
Latino men and under-represent all other immigrant groups. Our results are particularly important in light of research demonstrating that individuals’ political attitudes are influenced by the perceived ‘target group,’ or beneficiary, of a given policy, as well as scholarship demonstrating the media’s role in fostering a sense of ‘Latino threat.’

Given the evidence that ethnic cues can significantly influence individuals’ attitudes about public policy (Brader, Valentino, and Suhay 2008; Burns and Gimpel 2000; Domke, McCoy, and Torres 1999), and the relationship between public opinion and policy outcomes, these findings are cause for concern. 

**Paper Connection:**

While I do not plan on focusing my analysis on immigration policy, the link presented in this article highlights the power of the media in influencing the views of the public and its role in creating the idea of an ethnic threat. This threat creation can directly translate into negative immigration views and potential discouragement in the workforce.

### Benesch (2019) *Media coverage and immigration worries: Econometric evidence*

**Main Takeaways:**

Using detailed data on media coverage in Germany, we show that the
amount of media reports regarding migration issues is positively associated with concerns about immigration among the German population. This association is strongest when immigrants are the protagonists of media reports.

The effect of media coverage persists even when worries concerning
unemployment, crime, or the level of xenophobia are accounted for.

**Paper Connection:**

I aim to use this information as a case study to highlight that there is indeed a link between media reports regarding migration issues and concerns about immigration among a population. With this link fortified, I will see how correlated it is with changes in labor force participation that may stem from discouragement.

### Djourelova (2023) *Persuasion through Slanted Language: Evidence from the Media Coverage of Immigration*

**Main Takeaways:**

The author studies the persuasive effects of slanted language, exploiting a ban on
the politically charged term “illegal immigrant” by the Associated
Press (AP) news wire. They document a sizable diffusion of the ban from AP copy
to media outlets. Moreover, individuals exposed to the ban through local media show significantly lower support for restrictive immigration policies. This effect is more pronounced for moderates and in locations with fewer immigrants and does not transfer to views on
issues other than immigration

**Paper Connection:**

I aim to use this analysis as a case example of the potential effects that changes in media can have in improving labor force participation. By establishing my link between media and labor force participation I allow for these findings to transitively apply to improving labor force outcomes through less slanted language.
