# Abstract

As immigration policies grow with the nation and its political landscape, many narratives are presented to the media regarding the impact immigrants have on native-born workers. Through this paper, I hope to focus on the impact of immigration on labor force participation and see how the real-world impacts vary from those predicted based on theory. Furthermore, I aim to track media coverage regarding immigration policy and note if any changes in labor participation, or deviation from economic theory, could be attributed to media coverage. 

To ensure an analysis that is representative of the nuances within immigration policy, I plan to classify the interactions between native-born workers and immigrants in the following ways: immigrants are high-skilled complements, immigrants are low-skilled complements, immigrants are high-skilled substitutes, and immigrants are low-skilled substitutes. Most media coverage tends to highlight cases where immigrants are viewed as perfect substitutes, but I hope to shed some light on how often that is the case and how variety among immigrant types will yield different economic outcomes. I believe that most deviations from economic theory will coincide with a negative media perception. I hope that with these findings we can begin to understand how to structure more productive conversations surrounding immigration.

As my paper progresses, I hope to establish immigration’s impact on native-born workers ranging from unemployment to discouragement based on the works of Ríos‐Avila (Ríos‐Avila, 2016). Ríos‐Avila utilized the basic monthly Current Population Survey from 2001 and 2013 and identified workers who transitioned out of unemployment. The results yielded from their multinomial model suggest that immigration does not affect the probability of native-born workers finding a job. I hope to analyze the social landscapes of the states surveyed, and the types of skill levels the immigrants may have had to see how these variables may have influenced the outcome.

Some other works that I hope to analyze include the works of Borjas and Card which highlight trends surrounding native internal migration (Borjas, 2021) (Card, 2001). Following this, I hope to take inspiration from Scheve and establish core differences between theory and literature regarding labor-market competition and immigration policy (Scheve, 2001). Finally, I hope to look at the case study surrounding the effect of the Mariel Boatlift as researched by Card (Card, 1990). After a comprehensive review of existing literature, I hope to introduce a model, inspired by Dustmann, to display the labor market impact of immigration (Dustmann, 2008). 

Based on my personal beliefs surrounding bias and echo chambers, I hypothesize that deviations from economic theory will align with moments where media coverage surrounding immigration was predominantly negative. Noting this I expect to see changes in labor force participation to also trend in a similar fashion. Specifically, I feel that in cases where the media highlights an influx of workers who are high- or low-skilled complements, we may see a decrease in labor force participation due to discouragement. This prediction is made under the assumption that media can heavily influence public sentiment and, subsequently, labor market dynamics. In recognizing that finding a trend between media and labor market dynamics may be difficult, a higher-level hypothesis would be that immigrants will offer an initial shock of disincentivizing the domestic workforce until the labor market recalibrates.

I hope that this paper can contribute to more nuanced discussions on immigration by highlighting the diversity among immigrant types, their economic impacts, and the impact of media coverage.


# Introduction

Within recent years immigration has been a topic at the center of many debates. Whether that debate is focused on the utilization of resources, influxes of crime, or the sharing of cultures one common thread exists: how do immigrants impact native-born individuals? Within America, immigration has continued to become a polarized topic and never ceases to be mentioned in the media. While some sources offer unbiased reporting, many Americans consume media that fits within their own preconceived narrative. 

Through this paper, I hope to focus on the impact of immigration on labor force participation and see how the real-world impacts vary from those predicted based on theory. Furthermore, I aim to track media coverage regarding immigration policy and note if any changes in labor participation, or deviation from economic theory, could be attributed to media coverage. I hope to look at a trend analyzer to look up trigger phrases to note what tones are being used to describe immigration. For example, an article that I would deem favorable towards immigration would have trigger phrases like "bolster the economy" or "creates new jobs" while one that has a more negative take on immigration may have trigger phrases along the lines of "increases joblessness". To decrease bias, I hope to sample from multiple sources of media to ensure proper representation of multiple narratives.

The core goal of my research is to understand the economic impacts that the media has in regard to labor force participation. I believe that the best process to do this is to establish what economic theory believes will happen as a baseline and see how the real world deviates from this baseline. Throughout the research process, I hope to summarize what the current literature states to see where my findings exist within the academic world. On the highest level, the core point of distinction between my research and current literature is that I hope to understand what may be driving the changes in the labor force due to immigration.

To ensure an analysis that is representative of the nuances within immigration policy, I plan to classify the interactions between native-born workers and immigrants in the following ways: immigrants are high-skilled complements, immigrants are low-skilled complements, immigrants are high-skilled substitutes, and immigrants are low-skilled substitutes. An example of a high-skill substitute may be immigrants who are brought to work within innovative sectors like the technology sector. In direct contrast, an example of a low-skilled substitute maybe someone working a job in construction. Most media coverage tends to highlight cases where immigrants are viewed as perfect substitutes, but I hope to shed some light on how often that is the case and how variety among immigrant types will yield different economic outcomes. Moving beyond this oversimplification will not only help the labor force understand the true impact of immigration, but it can also lead to a more productive workforce as individuals feel less discouraged by changes within the labor market. Based on potential discouragement, I believe that most deviations from economic theory will coincide with a negative media perception. I hope that with these findings we can begin to understand how to structure more productive conversations surrounding immigration.
