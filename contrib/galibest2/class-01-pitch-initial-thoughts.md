# Pitch Initial Thoughts

## Prompt 1: Change in total government spending on welfare programs

Through my research paper, I hope to find a trend in the change in total government spending on welfare programs that target low-income families.  Some programs that I feel meet this criteria are SNAP, Medicare, and EITC.

One core question I hope to answer is how financial crises impact the budget for these programs. The reason why I believe financial crises are a good backdrop for this study is because not only is the government performing under a distressed budget, but many Americans may flock to the government for assistance. I believe this will allow us to see when the government decides to ramp up and scale back care in relation to the evolving crisis.

An interesting way that I think this data could be studied would be by holding inflation-adjusted aid values constant perpetually until a new number outranks it. I would then like to compare that more steady line to the actual spending line to compare the volatility. Some financial crises that I would love to look into are the following:

- The Great Depression
- The Financial Crisis from '07-'08
    - U.S. Housing Bubble Bursts 
    - Fed Announces Quantitative Easing in 08
- Obama's stimulus package

*This list is non-exhaustive and was inspired by the [Council on Foreign Relations' US Financial Crisis Timeline from 1992-2018](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-financial-crisis)*

I believe that the trend we will witness is that after every financial crisis government spending will increase to adjust for the needs of new families suffering from the crisis at hand and then overtime will decrease the budget. I feel that the rate at which the government scales back will be offset by programs or initiatives that may prove synergic and help out communities while achieving a greater goal. Hence, another topic I would like to study throughout the course of this research paper is whether or not there is a consistent trend of pulling money from welfare programs and reallocating the funds into other initiatives that may decrease the number of people needing welfare programs, to begin with.

Outside of the aforementioned financial crises, I would love to look at how government spending shifted during these other historic points:

- Hurricanes and natural disasters (e.g. Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Sandy, Wildfires in California)
- The implementation of the common core curriculum
- The covid-19 pandemic

I would hope to track the number of people needing welfare before and after these initiatives and events and see if there is a correlation between changes in government spending due to an ability to decrease those in need of welfare.

## Prompt 2: Change in labor force participation

Through my research paper, I hope to find a trend in the change in labor force participation as it relates to changes in the labor source and changes in capital. In order to study the change in labor source I would like to analyze how immigration policies have impacted the participation rate.

I would hope to compare the growth rates between native-born participation and native and non-native participation over the course of the years. Some core points I would hope to highlight are periods where immigration policies changed and see if these policies discouraged any workers or if they had a tangible impact on labor force participation. I would also track what the goal of the policy was and how the public interpreted it.

I believe that while non-native labor may be complementary to native labor and thus increase productivity and potentially help the labor force, I feel that many individuals may grow discouraged or displaced in the process and that the rates will not grow to as large of a degree considering the number of native individuals leaving the labor force.

In order to study the change in capital I would hope to study the impact of technological advancement on labor force participation. For example, I would love to see how the impact of the clean energy movement has impacted labor force participation in the energy sector. Another sector that would interesting to look at would be the labor force participation in jobs that do not require a college degree since these jobs may be at risk due to the current race to implement more automated intelligence.

I believe that there will be a small decrease in labor force participation as individuals aim to re-educate themselves to work with this more efficient form of capital but eventually, the rate will increase exponentially due to more skilled workers helping open up careers for lower-skilled individuals as well.

Other than looking at the impact of immigration on labor force participation, I would also like to look at how gender participation has shifted. Due to the large amount of literature surrounding the varying sensitivities along gender lines, I hope to be able to see if men or women are more sensitive to immigration or industry changes when it comes to their labor force participation.
