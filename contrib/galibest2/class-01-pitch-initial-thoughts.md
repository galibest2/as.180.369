# Pitch Initial Thought

## Prompt 1: Change in total government spending on welfare programs

I feel like some trends I would want to look into are how government spending was trending after certain financial crises and what would spending look like if those values were held over a prolonged rate. Some financial crises that I would love to look into are the following:

- The Great Depression
- The Financial Crisis from '07-'08
    - U.S. Housing Bubble Bursts 
    - Fed Announces Quantitative Easing in 08
- Obama's stimulus package

*This list is non-exhaustive and was inspired by the [Council on Foreign Relations' US Financial Crisis Timeline from 1992-2018](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-financial-crisis)*

Outside of these financial crises, I would love to look at how government spending shifted during these other historic points:

- Hurricanes and natural disasters (e.g. Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Sandy, Wildfires in California)
- The implementation of the common core curriculum
- The covid-19 pandemic

A core reason I would use these points as guideposts is due to how the government's budget may have been impacted by these stressful occasions or if the government eased spending due to expected synergies from certain programs or initiatives.

## Prompt 2: Change in labor force participation

I would want to see the change in the labor force participation rate and compare the growth rates between native-born participation and native and non-native participation. Core historic points I would love to focus on especially are major immigration reform points to see if immigration policies discouraged any workers or if they had a tangible impact on labor force participation.

Other than looking at the impact of immigration on labor force participation, I would also like to look at how gender participation has shifted.

Another approach that I was considering outside of demographic research would be to look at the impact of technological advancement on labor force participation. For example, I would love to see how the impact of the clean energy movement has impacted labor force participation in the energy sector. Another sector that would interesting to look at would be the labor force participation in jobs that do not require a college degree since these jobs may be at risk due to the current race to implement more automated intelligence.
